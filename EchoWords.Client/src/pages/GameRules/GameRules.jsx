            <h2>How to Play Echo Words</h2>

            <p className="rules-intro">
              Echo Words is a fast-paced word game where players take turns
              entering words that start with the last letter of the previous
              word, while also remembering and re-entering all previous words.
            </p>

            <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Player 1 starts by entering a word and pressing "Enter" to
                submit.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once Player 1 submits their word, it disappears after a brief
                moment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Player 2 must now:
                <ul>
                  <li>Re-enter Player 1's word.</li>
                  <li>
                    Add their own new word, ensuring the first letter of their
                    word matches the last letter of Player 1's word.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The game continues with each player:
                <ol>
                  <li>Re-entering all previous words in order</li>
                  <li>Adding their own new word that follows the pattern</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Each player has a limited time to complete their turn.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>

                remaining.
              </li>
              <li>Longer words are worth more points.</li>
              <li>Fast typing gives you a speed bonus.</li>
              <li>
                The more time left on the clock, the higher your score
                multiplier.
              </li>
              <li>Difficulty settings affect score multipliers.</li>
            </ul>

              <li>The game has a global timer that counts down.</li>
              <li>
                Correctly entering a new word adds bonus time to the clock.
              </li>
              <li>
                Correctly re-entering previous words also adds some bonus time.

              <li>Time bonuses vary by difficulty level.</li>
              <li>The game ends when time runs out.</li>
